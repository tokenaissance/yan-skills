<skill name="backlink" version="3.1" body-format="xml">

<why-xml>
The frontmatter above stays YAML because the Skill loader reads it for
discovery. Everything below is XML because this Skill is mostly laws and
routing, and a law that is easy to skim past is a law that gets broken. Tagged
blocks make "which rule did I just violate" answerable by name.
</why-xml>

<mission>
One business Skill for the complete backlink lifecycle. Do not split it back
apart, and do not create another browser-extension Skill — OpenCLI and its
Chrome extension are the connector underneath this Skill, never a separate
business workflow.

Two former Skills were merged in on 2026-08-16 and deleted: `backlink-analyzer`
(analysis templates, toxicity rubric, outreach — now in three references under
its original Apache-2.0 licence) and `browser-harvest` (pulling tables out of
logged-in dashboards — now <ref file="references/harvest.md"/>). The harvest
knowledge is general-purpose: ad platforms, e-commerce backends, any no-API
SaaS report. When a harvesting task has nothing to do with links, load this
Skill anyway and read that one reference.

<browser-runtime>
<summary>
`$backlink → scripts and policy → OpenCLI → the owner's authorized Chrome → website`

Every script here shells out to the `opencli` binary, which drives the owner's
own logged-in Chrome through the OpenCLI extension. No Playwright, no headless
instance, no remote runtime. That identity is the entire reason this Skill
exists, and it is why the laws below matter.

**Read <ref file="references/browser-runtime.md"/> before any browser work.** It
carries the measurements behind every law here, the two other drivers and what
they cost, and an ordered checklist for diagnosing "something stole my tab".
</summary>

<default-driver>
OpenCLI is the default for **everything**, including a quick ad-hoc look at one
page. It reaches the owner's Chrome through an extension plus a local daemon,
and because it is a CLI, any agent runtime that can run a shell command gets the
identical capability — Claude Code, Codex, anything else. Work done through a
runtime-specific tool cannot be replayed from a script or from another agent
later, which defeats the reason this Skill has scripts.

Use an existing OpenCLI adapter first. When no adapter exists, use a named
browser session with DOM/network inspection.
</default-driver>

<law id="one-session-one-tab" weight="load-bearing">
<statement>
`opencli browser &lt;session&gt;` is a one-page abstraction. **A session name owns
exactly one tab.** Different names never steal from, switch, or pollute each
other. So N pages need N session names.
</statement>
<why>
This inverts the intuition most people arrive with, which is why it is stated
first. Measured 2026-08-21 under three concurrent agents: distinct session names
produced **zero** cross-agent thefts across 4 rounds × 3 pages; three agents
sharing the name `work` produced 3, 12, and 2 thefts, one of them missing on
every check it made. Re-confirmed the same day against this Skill as written:
three agents told only to follow it scored **36/36 clean with zero leaked
tabs**.
</why>
<correct><![CDATA[
opencli browser recon-sw-notion --window background open "https://..."
opencli browser recon-sw-figma  --window background open "https://..."
opencli browser recon-sem-rival --window background open "https://..."
]]></correct>
</law>

<law id="no-multi-tab-api" weight="load-bearing">
<statement>
Do not use `tab new`, `tab select`, or `open --tab` to hold several pages under
one session. All three fail, and every one fails **silently** — the command
reports success and the next read returns the wrong page.
</statement>
<why>
Measured 2026-08-21 on opencli 1.8.6: a session tracks only its newest tab, so
earlier ids drop out of `tab list`; `tab select` returns success with no effect
on reads; `open --tab &lt;id&gt;` opens a **new** tab and leaves the named one
untouched; and `get` does not accept `--tab` at all, so a run using `get url` to
confirm its position cannot be right about it. One three-agent run took the
owner's Chrome from 11 tabs to 30 orphans.
</why>
<instead>
`--tab` works on `open`, `state`, `extract`, `find`, and `click`. When a read
must name its target, use `state --tab &lt;id&gt;`.

**Read this next sentence before you over-correct.** Under
<law-ref id="one-session-one-tab"/> a session owns exactly one page, so there is
nothing to disambiguate and **plain `get url` is safe and is the simplest
confirmation read**. The objection above is only about sessions holding several
pages. Three testers each flagged this as the passage most likely to be
misread — one of them nearly threaded a `--tab` id through the whole job to
obey a rule that did not apply.

<confirm-identity>
The canonical check after every navigation, and the one Law 4 exists to make
possible:
<cmd><![CDATA[
opencli browser "$S" --window background get url    # one page per session: safe
opencli browser "$S" --window background state      # same, plus title + elements (AX snapshot by default)
]]></cmd>
</confirm-identity>
</instead>
</law>

<law id="no-literal-session-name">
<statement>
Never write a literal session name as a default. In JS use
`defaultSession(base)` from `scripts/opencli-core.mjs`; in shell use
`SESSION="backlink-$$"`.
</statement>
<why>
"Another task stole my tab" is never the CLI round-robining — it is always two
tasks that picked the same name. The commonest source is documentation:
`opencli browser --help` opens with `opencli browser work open https://x.com`,
so every agent copying the example lands on `work`. This Skill caused the same
failure itself when `tools-share-open.mjs` defaulted to `backlink-panel`.
</why>
<code><![CDATA[
const session = flags.session ? validateSession(flags.session) : defaultSession('backlink-work');
]]></code>
<subagent-trap>
Subagents inherit the parent's environment, so several agents spawned inside one
conversation resolve to the same default. When fanning browser work across
parallel agents, give each an explicit `--session` or a distinct
`OPENCLI_SESSION_SUFFIX`.
</subagent-trap>
<naming>
Make names **describe the work**: `backlink-probe-&lt;suffix&gt;` beats `bl-1`. The
session name is the primary identifier. With the custom extension build
(PR #2316), the Chrome tab group now shows active session names
(`OpenCLI: session-a, session-b`), making groups distinguishable.
On the stock Web Store extension the group title is still the fixed
`"OpenCLI Browser"`.

**A name needs two distinguishing parts, and it is easy to ship only one.** The
suffix makes your task unique against *other* agents. It does nothing to
separate your own pages from each other, and by
<law-ref id="one-session-one-tab"/> a three-page job needs three names. So
`backlink-probe-$$` used for all three pages obeys this law's letter and breaks
Law 1. Vary both: `backlink-probe-p1-$$`, `-p2-$$`, `-p3-$$`.
</naming>
<help-text-bait>
`opencli browser --help` opens with `opencli browser work open https://x.com`.
That is the literal collision name this law exists to prevent, printed by the
tool itself, and an agent that consults `--help` for syntax after reading this
law will see the CLI modelling the anti-pattern. Trust the law. The same help
text also shows `--window background` trailing the URL, which does work — see
<law-ref id="background-by-default"/>.
</help-text-bait>
<cleanup>
Release the lease with `opencli browser &lt;session&gt; close` when done. A session
left open leaves a tab that looks exactly like live work somebody else is doing.

**Verify the close rather than trusting the message.** `close` prints
"Browser session tab lease released" whether or not the tab went with it, and
the native check costs one command — an empty `tab list` means the tab is
actually gone:
<cmd><![CDATA[
opencli browser "$S" close        # -> Browser session tab lease released
opencli browser "$S" tab list     # -> []   (anything else means it survived)
]]></cmd>
Counting tabs in Chrome from the outside cannot answer this while other tasks
are running, because their tabs are in the same count.
</cleanup>
</law>

<law id="claim-handles-first">
<statement>
Open every session you need up front and capture every handle, then start the
work loop. Do not interleave creation with use.
</statement>
<why>
Every driver tested shares one race window: the stretch between creating a page
and holding a stable handle to it. Two independent runs lost pages in exactly
that gap, because a bare `open` with no established handle resolves against
whatever "current" happens to mean at that instant.
</why>
</law>

<law id="background-by-default">
<statement>
Default every session to background mode. The flag sits **between** the session
name and the subcommand: `opencli browser &lt;session&gt; --window background &lt;command&gt;`.
</statement>
<why>
Background mode runs the owner's real logged-in Chrome without raising the
window. It is **not** headless — `navigator.webdriver` is `false`, the UA
carries no `Headless`, `plugins.length` is 5, and `visibilityState` is
`visible`. So "background will trip the site's bot defences" is not a real
concern, and there is never a reason to reach for foreground to look more human.

**Neither mode steals focus.** Nine concurrent agents across three drivers
checked the frontmost app before and after every navigation on 2026-08-21; the
host app stayed frontmost every time. If a person reports the screen "jumping
around", the cause is several tasks writing to one shared page — that is
<law-ref id="one-session-one-tab"/> being violated, not focus stealing.
</why>
<misplaced-flag>
Before the session name it fails with `unknown command: &lt;yoursession&gt;`, which
reads like a broken install rather than a syntax error — check flag position
before reinstalling anything.

**After the subcommand it works.** Re-measured 2026-08-21: `opencli browser s
open URL --window background` succeeds identically to the between form, and the
CLI's own `--help` prints that trailing form as its second example. An earlier
version of this law claimed both positions fail; a tester falsified it in one
command. Prefer the between form for consistency with the rest of this Skill,
and do not treat the trailing form as an error when you meet it in someone
else's script.
</misplaced-flag>
<exception>
Request foreground only when the user explicitly wants to watch. If a site
cannot be operated without stealing focus, stop and report that constraint.
</exception>
</law>

<other-drivers>
<driver name="agent-browser" verdict="no logged-in identity, ever">
It attaches over CDP, and CDP cannot reach the owner's Chrome: Chrome 136+
silently ignores `--remote-debugging-port` on the default user-data-dir
(verified on 151 — the flag is passed, no port is opened), and macOS TCC blocks
copying the profile out. Relaunching Chrome is wasted effort; do not suggest it.
Its `--profile` means a separate directory you log into once, unrelated to the
owner's sessions. Use it only for tasks needing **no** logged-in identity, and
address tabs by `--label`, never by the `t1`/`t2` positional index, which is a
shared namespace across agents.
</driver>
<driver name="Claude in Chrome" verdict="single agent, ad-hoc, prefer OpenCLI anyway">
It reaches the owner's Chrome but has no isolation boundary of any kind: one
flat tab group shared by every concurrent agent, and omitting `tabId` resolves
to "first tab in the shared group". It also has a reproducible bug where closing
one of your own tabs tears down your session's tab-group tracking and orphans
the rest. It is Claude-only, so anything built on it cannot be replayed from
another runtime.
</driver>
</other-drivers>

<preflight>
<cmd>node scripts/health.mjs</cmd>
Run before browser work. Use `--check-update` only when the user asks about
versions; an available update is informational, and upgrading OpenCLI needs a
separate request.

Read <ref file="references/safety-policy.md"/> before any fill, submission,
account, or logged-in operation.

Confirm ownership rather than assuming it:
<cmd>opencli browser "$SESSION" tab list   # should show only your own tab</cmd>
</preflight>

<panel-launch>
Both live behind one shared-account panel, and launching through the launcher is
mandatory — a deep link into the tool origin before the launcher runs lands on
`about:blank`.
<cmd>node scripts/tools-share-open.mjs --tool semrush</cmd>
Both entry points are **optional overrides**, not prerequisites.
`lib-tools-share.mjs` ships a `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD` and loads the Skill's
gitignored `.env`, so the scripts run with neither variable set — an earlier
revision of this file called them required, which sent a tester hunting for
configuration that was already there. Set them only to point at a different
dashboard:
<cmd><![CDATA[
export TOOLS_SHARE_DASHBOARD_URL="https://<your-authorized-dashboard>"
export TOOLS_SHARE_APP_ORIGIN="https://<origin-the-dashboard-launches-into>"
]]></cmd>
The launched application sits on a different host from the dashboard entry
point, so the second cannot be derived from the first.

All of these share one launcher, `lib-tools-share.mjs`. **Do not write a second
one.** A previous copy of the launch sequence inside `similarweb-query.mjs`
omitted three of the four known traps and failed with a generic "unavailable"
whose real cause differed every time.

**Check the subscription expiry before planning around it** — it is short-dated,
the scripts print it, and they warn inside 7 days.

**Budget the whole recon against the quota printed at launch.** Reusing a
session skips the launcher, which is the point, and the side effect is that the
quota text never re-renders — so no reused-session call prints a fresh reading.
A rule like "stop at 80%" cannot be enforced mid-run; decide the size of the
run up front.

**Raise your shell timeout before a batch, not after it fails.** A panel launch
costs 20–40s and each report ~15s, so five domains or a dozen keywords in one
call runs for minutes and a two-minute default kills it mid-flight. The scripts
write incrementally so nothing is lost, but the run still has to be restarted.

Everything else about cards, quota, and the traps is in
<ref file="references/authorized-data-sources.md"/>.

the session is already parked on the tool origin (`sessionReused: true` says
which happened).

<caution>
These metrics help discover and prioritize candidates. They never prove a
backlink is public, indexed, followable, or causally producing traffic. The
parsing traps that make a report silently return zeros are documented in
<ref file="references/authorized-data-sources.md"/> — read it before writing any
new reader, especially the rule that a readiness predicate must key on a **data
row**, never on a tab name, column header, or filter chip.

**Then check the parser against itself.** A ready page and a correct parse are
different claims, and the second one fails silently. One live run under-reported
**all five** domains it touched — the worst lost 91 rows of 93, and the one that
looked healthiest still lost 49 — with no error anywhere and a wrong written
conclusion on top.

The check is **two comparisons, and conflating them produces false alarms**:

<check level="1" compares="rawText vs parsed.rows.length">
Count the record-shaped lines in `rawText`, compare with `parsed.rows.length`.
A gap here means **your regex has a blind spot** — the rows arrived and you
dropped them. This is the silent, dangerous one. Fix the parser.
</check>
<check level="2" compares="the page's own headline count vs rawText">
Semrush prints its own total (`自然搜索排名: N`). If that exceeds what `rawText`
even contains, the rows **never reached you**: these tables are virtual-scroll
and only mount a fraction at a time, so a full pull needs the export, which
costs quota. This is a known ceiling, not a bug — say so rather than "fixed
the parser".
</check>

A live re-run shows both at once: three domains matched their headline exactly
(14/14, 22/22, 5/5) while one read 91 against a claimed 430. The first three
prove the parser; the fourth is level 2 and needs no fix.

Inspect every target independently. Never infer a form from a sibling site. A

Create a reviewed JSON payload with truthful values. For comment mode,
`description` is the comment body.

It revalidates the URL, form identity, field semantics, login state, and CAPTCHA
state, installs a submit guard, and never submits. The human reviews the
rendered page and performs final submission. Only after the user explicitly
authorizes one exact reviewed submission may the agent run
`release-submit-guard.mjs` — and releasing the guard still does not click
Submit.
</fill>
<staged-queue>
Lane B leaves forms on screen for the owner to finish. **One session name per
staged site** — a session owns one tab, so reusing one session overwrites the
previous staged form while the report still says N staged. `adapter-phpld.mjs`
carries the reference implementation.

<hard-limit>
These templates assume you already have the data. They do not fetch it. **A
report built from templates alone, with no observed rows behind it, is
fabrication.** Do not disavow links, contact site owners, or change production
sites unless the user separately asks. Treat third-party authority and traffic
estimates as directional and time-sensitive.

<ref file="references/harvest.md"/> before writing any scraping loop. It
documents failures that produce **plausible, silently wrong output**: virtual
scroll tables that are not `&lt;table&gt;` and drop rows without erroring, long URLs
that make whole rows vanish, execution-channel timeouts that look like failure
while the page loop is still running, and Chrome's intensive throttling
stretching a four-second loop into twenty-five minutes.

`scripts/harvest.browser.js` is the in-page collector. Its output arrives via a
Blob download rather than a return value, because the execution channel
truncates at roughly 1 KB.

<evidence-bar>
`submitted`, `public`, `indexed`, and `rel_verified` each require an evidence
note. Never promote a record from a filled form, a pending notice, or a
historical assumption. **`indexed` must name the engine** — `indexed@google`,
`indexed@brave`. An unqualified "indexed" is a claim about the whole web built
from one crawler's opinion.

</workflows>

<rules type="non-negotiable">
<rule id="no-coordinate-clicking">No coordinate-based "human-like" clicking.</rule>
<rule id="no-bypass">No CAPTCHA, Turnstile, login, paywall, quota, or account-scope bypass.</rule>
<rule id="unmeasured-is-not-qualified">
Never treat "not yet measured" as "qualified". The traffic gate only works if
unmeasured rows are excluded from a batch rather than waved through.
`--min-traffic` drops them by design; `--unmeasured` lists them as the next
screening queue, never as a batch.
</rule>
<rule id="validate-gates-against-known-bad">
A gate metric is validated against known-bad domains, never against famous ones.
Any signal a link network can manufacture for itself — DR, popularity rank,
index size — will pass a farm. Tranco's top-1M failed exactly this way: 48 of 73
confirmed farm domains sat inside it, from rank 134k to 998k.
</rule>
<rule id="no-fabrication">
No generic praise, fake identity, invented metrics, or a comment body that
ignores the article it sits under. Never invent a product fact to fill a field —
founder, pricing, address, launch date, user count, ownership, legal, contact.
Leave optional unknowns blank and stop a row whose required field is unknown.
</rule>
<rule id="relevance-ranks-never-gates">
A host site on a different topic is fine. Relevance and DR **rank** candidates,
they never **gate** them, and `nofollow` is an observation to record rather than
a reason to skip. Read <ref file="references/acquisition-doctrine.md"/> before
rejecting any target on quality grounds.
</rule>
<rule id="no-link-farms">
No link farms, spam generators, adult/malware surfaces, hidden reciprocal links,
temporary eligibility pages, or cloaking. Two identical give-aways in one place
— one site script across dozens of domains, and a promotional sentence repeated
word for word — mean one operator. Submitting to N of its domains buys one
link's value while accruing N times the footprint.
</rule>
<rule id="submission-is-not-a-backlink">
Do not record a submission as a backlink. This includes handing a URL to a
search engine: that is an index-submission channel, it publishes no link, and it
belongs in `data/index-submission.json` rather than the placement ledger.
</rule>
<rule id="observe-before-recording">
Do not record `follow`, `nofollow`, `ugc`, `sponsored`, or `indexed` without
observing it for the exact URL. A click, a completed registration, a saved
draft, a form that cleared itself, or a generic thank-you URL is **not** evidence
of a submission — those record what you did, and the ledger records what the
site did.
</rule>
<rule id="never-retry-ambiguous">
Do not automatically resubmit an unconfirmed target. Never retry an ambiguous
final action — one where the submit happened and the result was not observed.
Check the account backend, then the mailbox, then the public page. That state is
`outcome-unknown`, and it is not a failure.
</rule>
<rule id="anchor-policy">
Anchor text is the brand, the product name, or the naked canonical URL. Never
request dofollow treatment, never repeat a commercial exact-match anchor across
a campaign, and treat a paid or incentivised placement that publishes as a plain
follow link as **noncompliant** rather than as a win.
</rule>
<rule id="secrets">
Records carry aliases and evidence IDs. Passwords, OTPs, recovery codes,
cookies, OAuth parameters, magic links, raw session IDs, raw email addresses,
and phone numbers belong in none of them. Keep raw cookies, tokens,
authorization headers, and credentials out of logs.
</rule>
<rule id="traffic-figures-need-six-fields">
A third-party traffic figure without `source · metric · month · geography ·
device · date verified` is not a number. Store all six or store none.
</rule>
<rule id="http-over-mcp">
Prefer a documented HTTP endpoint over an MCP server when both serve the same
data from the same quota — the MCP adds a connection and a process without
adding capability, and a failure there is harder to tell apart from the service
being down. Keep MCP where it is the only authorized channel; never retire a
working path before the replacement has run successfully once.
</rule>
<rule id="verify-before-trusting-a-row">
Records carry `lastVerifiedAt` because this genre dies faster than it changes. A
channel that worked three months ago may be gone, gated, or `noindex` today.
Re-verify before a campaign; the validator warns on anything `live` older than
180 days. **Fixing a wrong row is worth more than adding a new channel.**
</rule>
<rule id="two-tables-two-claims">
`free-channels.json` records **a published link on a live page** and requires
`relObserved`/`anchorRendered`. `submission-targets.json` records **a submission
route that exists** and the validator rejects those fields there. A target
graduates from the second into the first the moment an actual anchor is
observed; until then it makes no promise about `rel`, anchor text, or
indexability, and the report must not imply one.
</rule>
<rule id="closed-loop-volume-check">
Two volume sources disagreeing by more than ~3× is not evidence that "volume
is unreliable" — it is a resolvable arithmetic question, and you MUST resolve
it before either number enters a decision. Pick a domain ranking #1 for the
disputed keyword, get its real traffic and Organic-Search share from
Similarweb, and get its ranked keywords with volumes from Semrush. Divide
observed organic clicks by the candidate volume total to get an implied CTR:
under 40% is plausible, over 100% falsifies that volume. This validates
**volume only, never intent** — a keyword can clear the CTR check and still be
worthless if the SERP shows the searchers do not want what you sell. A
falsification of one function of a tool (its volume model) says nothing about
another function of the same tool (e.g. SERP-composition reads have no
estimation model and are unaffected). Full worked example:
